# VM-Automation

Use Oracle VM software to complete this project proving my experience and understanding using Automation to launch a full stack

Full stack used as described below:
Tomcat is an application server to host Java Web Application like vprofile.

Nginx is a frontent server, web server and can be used as a Load balancer.

Mysql is a SQL Database server, similar are Mariadb, MSSql etc

RabbitMQ is the most widely deployed open source message broker.

Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls.

Launch VM machines from cloned repository on local machine

Navigate to the folder where these files are located
Execute command "vagrant up"

All VMs are launched and can ensure it is working as expected by entering http://web01 in browser address bar
Enter "admin_vp" as username and password.

On the website you can see the database, memcache, MQ, web and tomcat VMs all are working
